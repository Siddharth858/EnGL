<s> ORGANIC CHEMISTS MAKE MOLECULES VERY COMPLICATED MOLECULES BY CHOPPING UP A BIG MOLECULE INTO SMALL MOLECULES AND REVERSE ENGINEERING AND AS A CHEMIST ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO ASK MY RESEARCH GROUP A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IS COULD WE MAKE A REALLY COOL UNIVERSAL CHEMISTRY SET? IN ESSENCE COULD WE "APP" CHEMISTRY? </s>
<s> NOW WHAT WOULD THIS MEAN AND HOW WOULD WE DO IT? WELL TO START TO DO THIS WE TOOK A 3D PRINTER AND WE STARTED TO PRINT OUR BEAKERS AND OUR TEST TUBES ON ONE SIDE AND THEN PRINT THE MOLECULE AT THE SAME TIME ON THE OTHER SIDE AND COMBINE THEM TOGETHER IN WHAT WE CALL REACTIONWARE AND SO BY PRINTING THE VESSEL AND DOING THE CHEMISTRY AT THE SAME TIME WE MAY START TO ACCESS THIS UNIVERSAL TOOLKIT OF CHEMISTRY </s>
<s> NOW WHAT COULD THIS MEAN? WELL IF WE CAN EMBED BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL NETWORKS LIKE A SEARCH ENGINE SO IF YOU HAVE A CELL THAT AS ILL THAT YOU NEED TO CURE OR BACTERIA THAT YOU WANT TO KILL IF YOU HAVE THIS EMBEDDED IN YOUR DEVICE AT THE SAME TIME AND YOU DO THE CHEMISTRY YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE DRUGS IN A NEW WAY </s>
<s> SO HOW ARE WE DOING THIS IN THE LAB? WELL IT REQUIRES SOFTWARE IT REQUIRES HARDWARE AND IT REQUIRES CHEMICAL INKS AND SO THE REALLY COOL BIT IS THE IDEA IS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE A UNIVERSAL SET OF INKS THAT WE PUT OUT WITH THE PRINTER AND YOU DOWNLOAD THE BLUEPRINT THE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY FOR THAT MOLECULE AND YOU MAKE IT IN THE DEVICE AND SO YOU CAN MAKE YOUR MOLECULE IN THE PRINTER USING THIS SOFTWARE </s>
<s> SO WHAT COULD THIS MEAN? WELL ULTIMATELY IT COULD MEAN THAT YOU COULD PRINT YOUR OWN MEDICINE AND THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THE LAB AT THE MOMENT </s>
<s> BUT TO TAKE BABY STEPS TO GET THERE FIRST OF ALL WE WANT TO LOOK AT DRUG DESIGN AND PRODUCTION OR DRUG DISCOVERY AND MANUFACTURING BECAUSE IF WE CAN MANUFACTURE IT AFTER WE AVE DISCOVERED IT WE COULD DEPLOY IT ANYWHERE YOU DON AT NEED TO GO TO THE CHEMIST ANYMORE WE CAN PRINT DRUGS AT POINT OF NEED WE CAN DOWNLOAD NEW DIAGNOSTICS SAY A NEW SUPER BUG HAS EMERGED YOU PUT IT IN YOUR SEARCH ENGINE AND YOU CREATE THE DRUG TO TREAT THE THREAT SO THIS ALLOWS YOU ON-THE-FLY MOLECULAR ASSEMBLY </s>
<s> BUT PERHAPS FOR ME THE CORE BIT GOING INTO THE FUTURE IS THIS IDEA OF TAKING YOUR OWN STEM CELLS WITH YOUR GENES AND YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND YOU PRINT YOUR OWN PERSONAL MEDICINE </s>
<s> AND IF THAT DOESN AT SEEM FANCIFUL ENOUGH WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE GOING TO GO? WELL YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE YOUR OWN PERSONAL MATTER FABRICATOR BEAM ME UP SCOTTY </s>
